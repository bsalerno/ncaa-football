##### Power_6

This project was an analysis of the American Athletic Conference's "Power 6" slogan, which asserts that the AAC is among the top FBS conferences (commonly referred to as the "Power 5"). This slogan, along with the fact that I went to SMU (an AAC school) and worked for the football team, served as inspiration for the project. Also, ESPN's graphics on their television broadcasts of bowl games created the idea to use out-of-conference record as a proxy for conference strength, which I take one step further in the project by creating a matrix of all conferences records against each other.
